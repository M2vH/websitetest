This is a page about circle in SVG.  
On this page I want to show 3 ways of how to display a svg circle.


## 1. Inline SVG

The svg markup is written inline the html.


## 2. External SVG

The svg markup is written in an external file.  


### External file inside project

This file is stored inside this github project


### External file outside of my project

Therefore some webspace is needed.

## 3. Generate SVG with JavaScript

```javascript
/* put snippet here */
```


I would like to link to the RAW file [here:](https://github.com/M2vH/websitetest/raw/...) "Alternative Text"

I would like to display some svg code snippets in the following snippet.

```svg
<!-- layout:sample -->

```
