This is a page about circle in SVG.  
On this page I want to show 3 ways of how to display a svg circle.


### Inline SVG
The svg markup is written inline the html.


### External SVG
The svg markup is written in an external file.  


#### External file inside project
This file is stored in this github project


#### External file outside of my project

The RAW file can be found [here](https://github.com/M2vH/websitetest/raw/...)

I would like to display some svg code snippets.

```svg
<!-- layout:sample -->

```
